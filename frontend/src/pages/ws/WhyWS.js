          History of WebSockets and WebRTC
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        The development of real-time web technologies has significantly transformed how applications 
        handle instantaneous data exchange and communication. Two pivotal technologies in this domain are WebSockets and WebRTC, 
        each with its unique history and standardization process.

              WebSockets:
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            WebSockets emerged as a solution to the limitations of traditional HTTP communication, 
            which was primarily unidirectional and inefficient for real-time applications. 
            The need for a protocol that enabled full-duplex, persistent connections between clients and 
            servers became apparent with the rise of interactive web applications.
          WebSockets were first standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 6455 in 2011 <cite>(IETF, 2011)</cite>. 
          This protocol allows for continuous two-way communication over a single TCP connection, 
          significantly reducing latency and resource usage compared to repeated HTTP requests <cite>(Smith & Patel, 2022)</cite>.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          In addition to the IETF's role in formalizing the protocol, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standardized 
          the WebSocket API, ensuring seamless integration with web browsers and enabling developers to implement 
          real-time features such as live chats, online gaming, collaborative editing, stock market updates, and live notifications efficiently <cite>(W3C, 2011)</cite>.
            </Typography>

          <Box>
            <Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom>
              WebRTC: 
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
              WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication), introduced by Google in
              2011, was designed to facilitate direct peer-to-peer communication
              between browsers, eliminating the need for plugins or intermediary
              servers. WebRTC relies on several key protocols, including ICE
              (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) for network traversal,
              STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) to discover the
              public-facing IP address, and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around
              NAT) to relay data when direct peer-to-peer communication is not
              possible <cite>(W3C, 2017)</cite>.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            WebRTC was jointly standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). 
            The W3C focused on defining the JavaScript APIs and browser integration aspects, while the IETF developed the underlying 
            transport protocols and security frameworks. This collaborative standardization 
            has ensured that WebRTC remains interoperable across different platforms and browsers, 
            promoting widespread adoption and fostering innovations in real-time communication <cite>(Nguyen & Lee, 2023)</cite>. 
            It supports low-latency, secure communication for audio, video, and arbitrary
            data, enabling applications such as video conferencing, live
            streaming, and real-time collaboration tools.

              Analytical Component: Utility of WebSockets and WebRTC
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            While analyzing WebSockets, we observe a key paradox: while WebSockets are designed for bidirectional communication, 
            a significant portion of their real-world applications—like live sports scores, stock price updates, 
            and real-time dashboards—primarily leverage unidirectional flows <cite>(Fitzgerald & Dennis, 2019; Lee & Chen, 2021; Smith & Patel, 2022)</cite>. 
            These implementations essentially replicate what could be achieved with simpler, less resource-intensive technologies like Server-Sent Events (SSE) <cite>(Johnson & Wang, 2020)</cite>.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>  
              This underutilization of WebSockets’ true potential raises a critical question: are developers defaulting to WebSockets without 
              fully considering their architectural needs? Using WebSockets for unidirectional tasks 
              can result in unnecessary complexity and inefficiency, overshadowing the protocol's strengths <cite>(Brown & Davis, 2023)</cite>.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>  
              We argue that this trend not only highlights a lack of awareness about alternative protocols but also 
              reflects an over-reliance on “one-size-fits-all” solutions in real-time web development. 
              For applications that genuinely require bidirectional flows—such as chat apps, collaborative editing tools, and 
              online gaming—WebSockets shine as an indispensable solution <cite>(Martinez & O'Connor, 2022; Kim & Park, 2021)</cite>. 
              However, for simpler unidirectional use cases, their implementation can be seen as overengineering.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>  
              Moving forward, we believe there is a pressing need for developers to adopt a more nuanced, 
              use-case-driven approach to protocol selection. Leveraging WebSockets only when their bidirectional 
              capabilities are genuinely required can lead to more efficient, maintainable, and purpose-built systems. 
              Otherwise, we risk reducing a powerful protocol to a buzzword used out of convenience rather than necessity <cite>(Brown & Davis, 2023)</cite>.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
              In short, while WebSockets remain a groundbreaking protocol, their misuse for unidirectional applications 
              underscores the importance of thoughtful technology adoption over defaulting to trends <cite>(Gupta & Verma, 2021)</cite>.
