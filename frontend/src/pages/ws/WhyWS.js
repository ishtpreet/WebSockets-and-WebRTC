        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          WebSockets and WebRTC were developed to address the increasing demand
          for real-time communication capabilities on the web, overcoming the
          limitations of HTTP-based methods like polling and long polling.

              WebSockets: Revolutionizing Real-Time Communication
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
              WebSockets were introduced as a solution for enabling full-duplex,
              persistent communication between a client and server. Standardized
              in RFC 6455 by the IETF in 2011, WebSockets addressed
              inefficiencies such as high latency and resource consumption. This
              technology allowed applications like real-time chat, online
              gaming, collaborative editing, stock market updates, and live
              notifications to become feasible and efficient.

              WebRTC: Enabling Peer-to-Peer Connections
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
              WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication), introduced by Google in
              2011, was designed to facilitate direct peer-to-peer communication
              between browsers, eliminating the need for plugins or intermediary
              servers. WebRTC relies on several key protocols, including ICE
              (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) for network traversal,
              STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) to discover the
              public-facing IP address, and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around
              NAT) to relay data when direct peer-to-peer communication is not
              possible.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
              WebRTC was standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and
              the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It supports
              low-latency, secure communication for audio, video, and arbitrary
              data, enabling applications such as video conferencing, live
              streaming, and real-time collaboration tools.

              WebSockets are an ideal solution for scenarios requiring
              continuous, bidirectional communication between a client and a
              server. Their utility lies in their ability to maintain persistent
              connections, drastically reducing the overhead associated with
              frequent HTTP requests. Examples of applications leveraging
              WebSockets include:
            </Typography>
